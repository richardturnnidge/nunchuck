i2c Nunchuck controller interface.


WARNING... This is work in progress.

v0.05 is simple data
v0.07 has graphical lines displayed

nunchuck_demo_02 splits the dsiplay code and nunchuck.ini

nunchuck.ini can be used like a library of code you any project.

Added binary option for joystick so it can be used instead of Console8 type joystick.


However, if you find these routines useful, you could buy me a coffee ;-)
